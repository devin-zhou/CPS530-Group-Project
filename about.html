                <h4>Our History</h4>
                Founded by Ben Parker in 2002, Pizza Time has strived to be the best, with fresh ingredients, friendly customer service, and delicious pizza.
                Our team focuses on the core principals of what makes pizza so good.
                Since opening our doors 18 years ago, we've open 3 locations in the downtown core of Toronto, Ontario to feed hungry Ryerson students and Gould St. "individuals". 
                <p>
                    <h4>Our Ingredients</h4>
                    Our fresh dough is is made with Canadian flower, spring water, and olive oil to create the perfect thin crust. The vegetable toppings are 100% homegrown in Canadian farms to support local business. Coated with a generous layer of soft cheesy mozzarella and our family secret tomato sauce.
                    From our wood fired oven to our unprocessed ingredients, we are dedicated to offering the highest quality pizza experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Pizza Time, quality is guarenteed with the fast customer service we're known for, in store and when delivered.
